		<p>For my final project I had some trouble deciding what I wanted to create. I thought about creating a game with javascript such as snake or hangman. Ultimately those seemed like ambitious endevours. Ultimatley while scrolling though CodePen I found some cool efects created with a canvas and I decided I wanted to try and recreate that.
