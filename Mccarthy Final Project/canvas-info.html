	<p>So, what is happening on the project page? Well, basically, as your mouse and a circle get close the circle grows in size. I have given you an example of this with a single static circle to your left. As you get close it will grow and as you move away it will shrink. This is what's happening with each of the other circles on the previous page while they are moving.</p>
